# Aula IPM 3 - User and task analysis

- **Waterfall model: (Proven to not be the best)**
- Requirements specifications -> Deisng -> Code -> Testing and integration -> Maintenance

**We should use Iterative Design**
that keeps iterating between Design-> Implementation -> Evaluation.

**User-Centered Design** - Based on its needs, abilities, context, work and task.

Who are the users? - User analysis
What does the user need to do? - Task analysis

represent the data gathered from the user statistics and display it in an efficient way.

What we need to identify:

- Age, gender, ethnicity
- Education
- Physical abilities
- General computer experience
- Domain experience
- Applicatioon experience
- Work environment and social context
- Communication patterns
- ...

- Many applications have several classes of users, and we need to identify and characterize each one.
- For example, a buyer and a seller in an e-commerce application.

General method for task analysis is:
- Observe/ask
- Collect unstructured lists of words and actions
- Organize.

- Where
- How often
- What are its time or resource constraints
- How is it learned
- What can go wrong
- Who else is involved.

Interviews with the users might be:

- Structured
- Semi-structured
- Unstructured

- Plan the questions

- Contextual inquiry - observe the user in their own environment.

- Participatory design - users are involved in the design process. We need to replace these users with new ones if the process is long in order to have a fresh perspective.

For usability tests we should only give the user the task and not give them any hints.
