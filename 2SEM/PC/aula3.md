# Multithread in C

- we need to inforce the privacy of the variables when programming in C since they are public by default. (use static)

> #define PRIVATE static -> find and replace

> #include <stdio.h> -> find and replace da INTERFACE diretamente no ficheiro

- a char in C is the ascii code of the character

> #include <ctype.h> -> define tipos, int32, etc
