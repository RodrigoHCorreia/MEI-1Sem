# An introduction to Ethics

## What is Ethics?

- **Morality** - **rules of conduct** describing what people ought and ought not to do in various situations.

- **Ethics** - the philosophical study of morality; a **rational examination** into people's moral beliefs and behaviour.

- **Ethical Relativism (group of frameworks)** - There is **no universal moral norms of right or wrong.**

- **Subjective** Relativism - **individuals** create their own moral standards. The weakness is primarily when it affects others.
- **Cultural** Relativism - **every society has a group of rules and laws that decide on actual moral guidelines.**

- **Ethical Egoism** - each person should focus **exclusively** on their own **self-interest**.

### Deontology

- **Deontology** - the theory or study of **moral obligation**. In deontological ethics an action is considered morally good because of **some characteristic of the action itself**, not because the product of the action is good.
Many different ethical theories are based on deontological ethics.

- **Virtue Ethics** - an action that a **virtuous person** would do in the same circumstances.
**Paciency is a virtue**
Depending on the situation, one action that can be considered virtuous in one situation can be bad!

- **Kantianism** - We act only from **moral rules** that at the same time will be **universal moral laws**. Act so that you always treat **both yourself and other people as ends in themselves**, and **never only as a mean to an end.**

- **Social Contract Theory** (much complex)- Morality consists in a **set of rules** governing how **people** are to **treat one another**, that **rational people will agree to accept**, for their **mutual benefit**, on the condition that **others follow those rules as well.**
Consists of **positive rights** (obligations) and **negative rights** (freedom of speach, no one can interfear).
Consists of **absolute rights** (right to be alive, can not be taken away) and **limited rights.** (right to liberty, you can do what you want, until u do a crime and go to jail, losing that right or covid for example)
One basis is **Rawl's Principles of Justice.**
**First principle** - Each person may claim a "fully adequate" number of basic rights and liberties, such as freedom of thought and speech, freedom of association, the right to be safe from harm, and the right to own property, so long as these claims are consistent with everyone else having a claim to the same rights and liberties.
**Second principle** - Any social and economic inequalities must satisfy two conditions: first, they are associated with positions in society that everyone has a fair and equal opportunity to assume; and second, they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

### Consequentialism

- The theory that the value and especially the moral value of an act should be judged by the **value of its consequences** (its the end that matter, not quite the action)

- **Ethical Altruism** - Unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others. (opposite of egoism)
- A theory of conduct that regards the **good of others as the end of moral action.**

- **Utilitarianism** (prob most used) - An **action** is right or wrong to the extent that it **increases** (or **decreases**) the total happiness of the a**ffected parties.** (Action Utilitarianism)
- We ought to adopt moral rules, that if followed by everyone, lead to the greatest increase in total happiness over all affected parties. (Rule Utilitarianism)
