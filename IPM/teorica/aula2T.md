# HCI Continuation - Human Computer Interaction

- Why is the default a certain way and why? always justify or have an idea of why the default is the way it is.
- Think about the context of your application, and which are the best goals to achieve (security, usability, efficiency, etc).

## Usability

- **Effectiveness**, **efficiency**, **satisfaction** with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments.

- **Functional specifications:** what the system should do.
- **Usability specifications:** how the system should do it.

- **Attributes:**
  - **Learnability** - Easy to learn and achieve maximal performance
  - **Efficiency** - Fast productivity
  - **Memorability** - Easy to remember how to use
  - **Errors** - Low user error rate
  - **Satisfaction** - Pleasant to use

The usability **can** be measured in the lab or in the wild by presenting the system to the user and asking them to perform a task.

- **Trade-offs:**
  - **Novices** - need learnability
  - **Experts** - need efficiency
  - **Infrequent** users - need memorability
- This depends on the context of the application.

## User Experience (UX)

- **Usability** is a part of **User Experience**.

**Software life cycle:**

Requirement specs -> design -> code -> testing and integration -> maintain
This is a cycle, and it's not linear.
