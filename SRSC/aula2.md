## Networks and Security

- Attacks against Communication Resources - Network-targeted attacks
- Attacks against Computer System Resources - Attacks against users (human errors, malicious users, etc.)

- How to resist to an attack that is performed by the system administrator??
  - Intrusion Prevencion Systems
  - Intrusion Detection Systems - If something goes wrong, we need to know.
  - Intrusion Recovery Systems - Not only you detect, but you also recover.

- Process Level abstraction

### Layering:

**Communication** - Network Protocol Stacks - All the protocols in this stack are **not secure**

**Computation** - Systems Resources (SW/FW/HW) Stack

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
RARP - Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
